# Linear Optimization

This repository contains opertaions and supply chain optimation projects using python and data science to solve challenging real world problems.<br> 
Some of these I have used to manage my Operations and Supply Chain responsibilities throughout my career.<br>
Others draw inspiration from the people I follow and recent advances in supply chain optimization techniques.<br>

Hope the reader enjoys the notebooks and finds these analyses insightful.<br>
