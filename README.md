This repository contains optimation projects.<br> 
Some of these I have used to manage my Operations and Supply Chain responsibilities throughout my career.<br>
Others draw inspiration from the people I follow and recent advances in supply chain optimization techniques.<br>

Hope the reader finds these analysis insightful.<br>
